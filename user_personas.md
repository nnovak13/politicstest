User Personas


   * Old person

      * Old Man Dingus, 80

         * Old man Dingus has seen better days. These computers and their buttons. Kids these days and their hippidy hoppidy music and rollerblade scooters. Well, listen, Dingus. You’ve voted every election since, like, a long time ago, so let Giveash!t be the site that lets you find and support the candidate who shares your blatant racism and condemnation of all but Frank Sinatra. Because Dean Martin was a pussy. And so was that Jimmy Carter guy.




   * Young people

      * Lil’ Eugene, 18

         * Lil’ Eugene can vote and use all the computers. All of them. Lil’ Eugene is new to this voting thang, so he needs an easy way to find check out whats a’happening down in DC-town so he can boogaloo down to the polling station with the confidence that he knows how to boogaloo and vote for incumbents or the, um,…others.

      * Gertrude, 21

         * Gertrude is pretty awesome. She’s a Chem major at Holy Cross and killing it. She’s pretty preoccupied with her studies and being awesome, so frankly, a site like this that can allow her to easily see how the current Congress is (mis)behaving and what their campaign/financial motivations are allows her to keep up with all the cooler-speak while continuing to kill it, bro.





   * Middle-aged

      * Dan, 42

         * Dan’s a busy single-father of three. His boss is always telling him about politics, and, you know, Dan isn’t quite sure his boss knows what he’s talking about. So to stick it to the man without really sticking it to the man, Dan’s able to look up the recent bills, their status, and legislatures to hold them politicians accountable. Because his boss is infallible.

      * Marsha, 50

         * Marsha is a CEO of a Wall Street firm. She wants to know what the hell her competitors are paying these loonies in DC and what the results they’re getting. Giveash!t allows her to look up all the crap during lunch. Which says something.
